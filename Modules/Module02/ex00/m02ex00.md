### Memory Leak:
A **memory leak** occurs when a program allocates memory dynamically (using `new` or `malloc`), but fails to release it (using `delete` or `free`) after it's no longer needed. This results in unused memory that the program cannot access or reuse, leading to increased memory consumption over time, which can cause the program to slow down or crash, especially in long-running applications.

### Dangling Pointer:
A **dangling pointer** is a pointer that continues to point to a memory location after the object it points to has been deallocated (freed). Accessing or dereferencing a dangling pointer can cause undefined behavior, including crashes or corrupting data, because the memory it points to is no longer valid.

### Using Smart Pointers in C++ to Avoid Memory Leaks and Dangling Pointers

To demonstrate the use of **smart pointers** in C++, let's expand the example of a `Car` class and use **`std::unique_ptr`** and **`std::shared_ptr`** to manage the lifetime of dynamically allocated `Car` objects. These smart pointers automatically handle memory management and ensure that objects are deleted when they go out of scope.

#### 1. Example: `std::unique_ptr`

A **`std::unique_ptr`** is a smart pointer that owns a dynamically allocated object exclusively. Only one `unique_ptr` can own a given object at any time, and it automatically deletes the object when it goes out of scope.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <memory>  // For smart pointers

class Car {
public:
    Car(const std::string& model) : model_(model) {
        std::cout << "Car " << model_ << " created." << std::endl;
    }

    ~Car() {
        std::cout << "Car " << model_ << " destroyed." << std::endl;
    }

    void drive() {
        std::cout << "Driving the " << model_ << " car." << std::endl;
    }

private:
    std::string model_;
};

void createCarWithUniquePtr() {
    std::unique_ptr<Car> car = std::make_unique<Car>("Tesla Model S");
    car->drive();
    // No need to manually delete car, it's automatically destroyed when going out of scope.
}

int main() {
    createCarWithUniquePtr();
    // car is automatically deleted when it goes out of scope here
    return 0;
}
```

**Explanation:**
- `std::make_unique<Car>("Tesla Model S")` creates a `unique_ptr` that points to a dynamically allocated `Car` object.
- The `unique_ptr` automatically deletes the `Car` object when it goes out of scope, preventing memory leaks.
- No need to manually call `delete`.

#### 2. Example: `std::shared_ptr`

A **`std::shared_ptr`** is a smart pointer that allows multiple pointers to share ownership of a single dynamically allocated object. The object is only deleted when the last `shared_ptr` owning it goes out of scope.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <memory>  // For smart pointers

class Car {
public:
    Car(const std::string& model) : model_(model) {
        std::cout << "Car " << model_ << " created." << std::endl;
    }

    ~Car() {
        std::cout << "Car " << model_ << " destroyed." << std::endl;
    }

    void drive() {
        std::cout << "Driving the " << model_ << " car." << std::endl;
    }

private:
    std::string model_;
};

void createCarWithSharedPtr() {
    std::shared_ptr<Car> car1 = std::make_shared<Car>("BMW M3");
    {
        std::shared_ptr<Car> car2 = car1;  // Now both car1 and car2 point to the same object
        car2->drive();
        // car2 goes out of scope, but the car is still owned by car1
    }
    // car1 goes out of scope and the car is destroyed when it's no longer referenced
}

int main() {
    createCarWithSharedPtr();
    // Car is automatically destroyed here when car1 goes out of scope
    return 0;
}
```

**Explanation:**
- `std::make_shared<Car>("BMW M3")` creates a `shared_ptr` that points to a dynamically allocated `Car` object.
- The `shared_ptr` handles reference counting. When another `shared_ptr` (e.g., `car2`) shares ownership of the same `Car` object, the reference count increases.
- The `Car` object is only deleted when the last `shared_ptr` (in this case, `car1`) goes out of scope and the reference count reaches zero.

### Key Differences Between `std::unique_ptr` and `std::shared_ptr`:
- **`std::unique_ptr`**: Exclusive ownership; the object is destroyed when the `unique_ptr` goes out of scope. There can be only one `unique_ptr` to an object at a time.
- **`std::shared_ptr`**: Shared ownership; multiple `shared_ptr`s can point to the same object, and the object is destroyed only when the last `shared_ptr` goes out of scope.

### Advantages of Using Smart Pointers:
1. **Automatic Memory Management**: You don't need to manually manage memory with `new` and `delete`, which prevents memory leaks and dangling pointers.
2. **Exception Safety**: If an exception occurs, smart pointers automatically clean up the allocated memory, avoiding memory leaks.
3. **Ease of Use**: Smart pointers provide a simple and intuitive way to manage the lifecycle of dynamically allocated objects.

### Conclusion:
Smart pointers, like `std::unique_ptr` and `std::shared_ptr`, provide automatic and safe memory management in C++, preventing common issues like memory leaks and dangling pointers. By using these smart pointers, you can ensure that objects are cleaned up when they are no longer needed, leading to safer and more maintainable code.
